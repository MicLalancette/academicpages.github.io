Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto since September 2017, where I am supervised by Prof. Stanislav Volgushev. Prior to joining Toronto, I completed a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a M.Sc. in Statistics at the Université de Montréal.
